# TextTree

The TextTree extension provides syntax highlighting for the [TextTree format](http://github.com/gbif/text-tree),
an indented plain text format to define taxonomic trees.
It is a supported by [ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org) to import and export taxonomic data.

## Color Theme
Please make sure to also switch your color theme in your settings to the bundled `TextTree` theme.

## File mappings
When installed files with a suffix `.txtree` and `.tree` should automatically make use of it.
